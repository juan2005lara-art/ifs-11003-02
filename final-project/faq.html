        <h2>What is the primary goal of the Mars Rover Program?</h2>
        <p>The overarching goal of the Mars Exploration Program is to determine if Mars ever had the right conditions to 
            support life, to better understand the planet's climate and geology, and to prepare for future human exploration. 
            Each rover contributes a unique piece to this puzzle; for example, Spirit and Opportunity confirmed the presence of
            past water, Curiosity investigated the surface chemistry, and Perseverance is actively searching for signs of
            ancient microbial life and collecting samples for eventual return to Earth.</p>

        <h2>How long does it take to get to Mars and how do the rovers land?</h2>
        <p>The journey to Mars typically takes about 6 to 11 months, depending on the launch window and specific mission 
            trajectory. The landing process, known as Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), is a complex series of events that 
            occur from the moment the spacecraft hits the Martian atmosphere until it safely touches down on the surface. 
            Techniques vary by rover size: smaller rovers like Sojourner and the MER twins (Spirit and Opportunity) used 
            airbags to bounce to a soft landing, while the much larger Curiosity and Perseverance rovers required a 
            sophisticated "sky crane" maneuver, using a rocket-powered descent stage to slowly lower them to the surface on 
            cables.</p>

        <h2>What happens to the rovers after their missions end?</h2>
        <p>Mars rovers are designed to be highly reliable and durable, but eventually, their missions come to an end due to
            factors like dust accumulation on solar panels (Spirit and Opportunity), component failure, or simply being shut 
            down after a long, successful run. Once operations cease, the rovers are left on the Martian surface as historical
            artifacts of human ingenuity and exploration. The data they collected is archived and made available to 
            scientists worldwide to continue studying the Red Planet.</p>
