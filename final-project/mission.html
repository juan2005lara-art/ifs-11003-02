        <h1>A Legacy of Exploration: The History of Mars Rovers</h1>
        <p>NASA's Mars Exploration Program is a continuous journey of discovery, with each robotic rover mission building upon 
            the technological and scientific successes of its predecessors. From the first small technology demonstration to 
            the car-sized scientific laboratories of today, these missions have fundamentally changed our understanding of the
            Red Planet.</p>

            <h2>The Pathfinders: Sojourner (1997)</h2>
            <p>The Mars Pathfinder mission, which included the Sojourner rover, was a revolutionary demonstration of a low-cost,
                high-impact approach to planetary exploration.</p>

            <h3>Mission Goals and Overview</h3>
            <p>The primary goal was a technology demonstration: proving a cost-effective system could successfully land a 
                spacecraft and a free-ranging robotic rover on Mars. Scientists aimed to analyze the atmosphere, climate, geology,
                and rock composition of the landing site, Ares Vallis, an area believed to be an ancient flood plain.</p>

            <h3>Launch and Landing Details</h3>
            <p>Sojourner launched atop a Delta II rocket on December 4, 1996, and landed on Mars on July 4, 1997, using an innovative
            airbag landing system—a bouncy, safe method that cushioned the impact.</p>

            <h3>Major Discoveries or Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>Sojourner was the first wheeled vehicle to explore the surface of another planet. It operated for 83 days, far 
                exceeding its planned operational life of just one week. It returned over 550 images and performed 15 chemical
                analyses of rocks and soil, providing evidence that Mars was once a warmer, wetter place.</p>

            <h3>Key Technical or Design Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> A small, 23-pound (10.6 kg) rover, roughly the size of a microwave oven.</li>
                <li><strong>Power: </strong>Solar panels provided its power</li>
                <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> It featured a six-wheeled rocker-bogie suspension system (later used in all 
                    subsequent NASA rovers) and could not venture more than about 39 feet (12 meters) from the lander, which 
                    served as its main communication hub with Earth.</li>

            <h2>The Twin Robot Geologists: Spirit and Opportunity (2004-2010/2018)</h2>
            <p>The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission featured two identical, golf-cart-sized rovers, Spirit and Opportunity,
            whose longevity and discoveries dramatically changed the scope of Mars exploration.</p>
            
            <h3>Mission Goals and Overview</h3>
            <p>The twins were sent to different locations to search for answers about the history of water on Mars. Their core 
                mission was to "follow the water"—characterizing rocks and soils that held clues to past water activity and 
                assessing whether those ancient environments were conducive to life.</p>

            <h3>Launch and Landing Details</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong></strong> Spirit: </strong>Launched on June 10, 2003, landed in Gusev Crater on January 4, 2004.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Launched on July 7, 2003, landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Major Discoveries or Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>Both rovers found dramatic evidence that Mars was once much wetter and warmer than it is today.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spirit</strong>found evidence of ancient hot springs and volcanic activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity</strong>landed in a small crater and found spherical mineral deposits nicknamed
                    "blueberries," formations of gray hematite that typically form in the presence of water.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both missions far outlasted their planned 90-sol (Martian day) primary missions. Spirit was active until 2010, 
                and Opportunity operated for nearly 15 years, covering over a marathon's distance (45 kilometers/28 miles)—an 
                off-world distance record.</p>

            <h3>Key Technical or Design Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Larger than Sojourner, about the size of a golf cart and weighing around 400 pounds (180 kg).</li>
                <li><strong>Power:</strong>Primarily solar-powered, which ultimately led to their demise during severe, planet-wide
                    dust storms that blocked sunlight.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobility:</strong>They used an improved rocker-bogie system and were the first rovers to use 3D vision
                    and autonomous navigation capabilities to drive themselves across the terrain.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>The mission history continues with the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, which transitioned from solar power to 
            nuclear power and refined the search for habitability, as detailed on the [link to main rover page] main rover page.</p>
