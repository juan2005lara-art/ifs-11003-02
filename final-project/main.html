        <h2>Brief Overview</h2>
        <p>NASA's Mars Exploration Program utilizes robotic rovers to explore the surface of Mars, seeking evidence of past water,
         potential signs of ancient life, and paving the way for future human missions. This site highlights two car-sized 
         rovers that represent the pinnacle of robotic exploration: Curiosity and Perseverance..</p>

        <h3>The Curiosity Rover (MSL)</h3>
        <p>The Curiosity rover, part of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, set out to determine if Mars ever had the 
         right environmental conditions to support small life forms called microbes.</p>

        <h4>Mission Goals and Overview</h4>
        <p>The primary objective of the car-sized Curiosity is to assess the habitability of Mars. Its mission involves 
            studying the planet's climate and geology, and the data collected helps scientists understand the history 
            of water on Mars and the potential for past life. The rover continues its extended mission, exploring the 
            layered deposits of Mount Sharp within Gale Crater.</p>

        <h4>Launch and Landing Details</h4>
        <p>Curiosity launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on November 26, 2011, aboard an Atlas V rocket. After an 
            eight-month journey, it executed a complex landing maneuver never before attempted, touching down safely in Gale
            Crater on August 6, 2012, using a "sky crane" system.</p>
        
        <h4>Major Discoveries or Accomplishments</h4>
        <p>Early in its mission, Curiosity found chemical and mineral evidence that Gale Crater once hosted a lake and an 
            environment that could have supported microbial life billions of years ago. The rover's drill has extracted powder 
            from rocks that revealed ingredients ancient life would have needed to survive. Curiosity also provided crucial 
            data on the high, dangerous levels of radiation on Mars, information vital for designing safer human missions.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Technical or Design Features</h4>
        <p>Curiosity is the size of a small car and is significantly larger and more capable than previous rovers. Key 
            features include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> Unlike the solar-powered Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity uses a nuclear power source 
                (Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator - MMRTG) that relies on decaying plutonium pellets to 
                generate energy and recharge its batteries.</li>
            <li><strong> Instruments:</strong> It is equipped with 10 advanced science packages, including a laser (ChemCam) that can 
                zap rocks from a distance to analyze their chemical content and a 7-foot long robotic arm with a camera for 
                close-up inspection and "selfies".</li>
            <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> The rover has 17 cameras in total for navigation, hazard avoidance, and scientific imaging.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Perseverance Rover</h3>
        <p>Building on the lessons of prior missions, the Perseverance rover represents the next generation of Mars exploration
            , with an ambitious goal of seeking actual signs of ancient microbial life and caching samples for return to Earth.</p>
        
        <h4>Mission Goals and Overview</h4>
        <p>Perseverance is focused on astrobiology and has four main science objectives: studying Mars' habitability, seeking 
            biosignatures of past microbial life, collecting and caching rock and soil samples, and preparing for human 
            exploration. It also serves as the first leg of a planned international Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign.</p>

        <h4>Launch and Landing Details</h4>
        <p>The Mars 2020 mission spacecraft, carrying Perseverance, launched on July 30, 2020, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
            It successfully landed in the Jezero Crater, a location believed to be an ancient river delta with high potential 
            for preserving signs of life, on February 18, 2021.</p>
        
        <h4>Major Discoveries or Accomplishments</h4>
        <p>Since landing, Perseverance has made discoveries about the volcanic history and habitability of Jezero Crater. It
             has successfully collected and documented multiple core samples of Martian rock and atmosphere, sealing them in 
             tubes for future retrieval. A major technological accomplishment was the deployment and coordination with the 
             Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, the first aircraft to achieve controlled flight on another planet.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Technical or Design Features</h4>
        <p>Perseverance is the most sophisticated rover NASA has ever sent to Mars, sharing a similar car-sized design and MMRTG 
            power source with Curiosity. Key innovations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sample Caching System:</strong> The rover is the first to include a complex system to cut intact rock cores
                 and seal them for future retrieval.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Navigation:</strong> It features a Terrain-Relative Navigation system for a safer landing in
                 the challenging Jezero Crater terrain, and enhanced self-driving capabilities to cover more ground efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong> Demonstrations: </strong>Perseverance carries the MOXIE instrument, which successfully produced oxygen
                 from Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere, demonstrating a key technology for future human life support and rocket
                 propellant production.</li>
            <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> The mission has more cameras than any previous interplanetary mission, with 19 on the rover itself,
                 providing breathtaking images and a high-definition view of the landing process.</li>
        </ul>
